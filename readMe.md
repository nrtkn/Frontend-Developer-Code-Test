- You are asked to add a third notification type called "Popup".
- Popup should be displayed when you press the "Click to Show Popup" button in the application.
- The popup should have the approximate appearance in the image delivered to you. [**See Image**](https://pasteboard.co/K3lBf66.png)
- The content you need to show in the popup should be displayed by pulling from the JSON file named "notification.json" in the project.
- Optionally, you can add an action or functionality you want to show your ability to the "Free Action Button" button in the application.
